/**
 * A row of mutually exclusive options, as one control.
 *
 * Written four times across the libraries and wrong in three of them, in the
 * same way each time: a nested radius has to be the outer radius minus the
 * gap, or the inner curve fights the outer one. Product Library had 10 inside
 * 14 with a 3px gap; Characters had 6 inside 14 with 2. Both read as a chip
 * that does not fit its slot.
 *
 * The other half of the mismatch was invisible in the numbers: globals.css
 * gives every `button` a squircle corner, so a squircle chip sat inside a
 * plainly-rounded shell no matter what the radii said. The shell is a
 * squircle too here.
 *
 * One constant, one place: change PAD or the radius and every segmented
 * control in the app stays nested.
