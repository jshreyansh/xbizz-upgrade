/**
 * tailwind-merge only knows Tailwind's OWN scale names. Our design tokens add
 * custom ones, and left unregistered they are misclassified — silently
 * breaking both directions of the merge:
 *
 *   twMerge("text-white", "text-body")   -> "text-body"
 *        text-body is read as a text COLOUR, so it cancels text-white and the
 *        text renders in the inherited colour. This is what made the brand
 *        "Save & Apply" button render near-black on orange, and it dropped
 *        the colour from every Chip.
 *
 *   twMerge("text-label", "text-brand")  -> "text-brand"
 *        the same collision the other way, so <Text size tone> lost its SIZE.
 *
 *   twMerge("rounded-card", "rounded-full") -> both kept
 *        no dedupe at all, so a call site could not override a primitive's
 *        radius and CSS source order decided the winner.
 *
 * Registering the token names in their real class groups fixes all of it.
 * Keep these lists in step with the @theme block in globals.css.
